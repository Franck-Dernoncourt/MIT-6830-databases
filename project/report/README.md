6.830 project report
====================
Overview: We plan to implement 2 different machine learning algorithms for MADlib. We have chosen the 2 algorithms below since they represent a wide range of types of machine learning algorithms: one classification algorithm and one prediction algorithm.

Model-Based Boosting: A class of gradient descent classification algorithms for optimizing general loss functions that uses componentwise least squares, either of parametric linear form or smoothing splines, or regression trees as base learners for fitting generalized linear, additive and interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data. R has a package called mboost which implements generalized linear and generalized additive models utilizing flexible boosting algorithms for (constrained) minimization of the corresponding empirical risk function. We will implement the mboost equivalents in C++ for MADlib. We can test these algorithms on gene expression data.

Genetic Programming: Non-linear symbolic regression. The term "symbolic regression" represents process during which are measured data fitted by suitable mathematical formula like "x^2 + C", "sin(x) + 1/e^x",  etc. This process is amongst mathematician quite well known and used when some data of unknown process are obtained. Symbolic regression is based on evolutionary algorithms and its main aim is to "synthetise" in an evolutionary way such program (mathematical formulas, computer programs, logical expressions, etc...) which will solve user defined problem as well as possible. While domain of evolutionary algorithms is of numerical nature (real, complex, integer, discrete), domain of symbolic regression is of functional nature, i.e. it consist of function set like (sin(), cos(), gamma(), MyFunction(),...) and so called terminal set (t, x, p, ...). From mix of both sets is then synthetised final program, which can be quite complicated in point of view of its structure. We plan to use it to unravel unknown relation between attributes.
